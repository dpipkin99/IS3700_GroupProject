  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Our Props to You! We are a family business that designs, creates and repairs theater props. We primarily serve the Houston, TX area, but shipping is available. </p>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Over the years, I have volunteered to make props for a community youth theater. Mostly because of my overy-ambitious ideas and lack of a good concept of time, my family has pitched in (rescued me) more and more. On any given day, you can find all sorts of random props parts on our kitchen table and pretty much all around our house.
  The allure of making unusual or especially challenging props draws me in like an unavoidable vortex. In early 2019, a director was complimenting me on some Lion King, Jr. props, and jokingly said something like, "So are you going to make our Olaf puppet in the Fall?" Understand that this was said when we were neck deep in props at our house---we were in the middle of rehearsals...
  I had already recruited my clan to help with props during every spare moment, and our house closely resembled a barn (the mere mention of Grassland Dancers now makes us shudder!) Still, I couldn't help but find out what the Olaf puppet would entail. After extensive research, I messaged the director saying, "I'm pretty sure I can make the Olaf puppet!"
  Then came Sven....
  And more Olafs and more Svens....
  Now people from all around are asking me to make more props....
  So here we are, launching a business page to give folks an opportunity to see what we do and make our services more accessible. 
  Rags is a great help, and we wouldn't know what to do if he wasn't there to oversee and test our projects. He is always there for us. Right there. Right in the middle. As a gesture of gratitude for all the late nights and devotion, we have a page just for him.</p>

  <h3>Services</h3>
<p>Our specialty is difficult-to-find props. It is important to us that they work well for the actors. When possible, we will customize the props to best fit the actor's size and needs.
  Depending on current demand, props may be available to purchase or rent.
  We also have the ability to repair many props already owned by our customers.</p>
